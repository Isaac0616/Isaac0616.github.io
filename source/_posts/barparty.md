## Exploit

{% asset_img barcodes.jpg %}

Actually, I can still scan the barcodes which are marked by the red pointers by [QuickMark](http://www.quickmark.com.tw/). They are `C0d3s}`, `_B4r_`, and `IW{Bar` from top to bottom.

{% asset_img deal-with-it.gif %}

Otherwise, it takes only a few minutes to put the pieces together by Photoshop.
